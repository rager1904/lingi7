GUIDING PRINCIPLE:
`search_entities` describes WHAT THE USER WANTS THE CATALOG TO RETURN. It is never the item the user is merely referencing for comparison, styling, or context.

DECISION LOGIC (apply in order, stop at the first match):

1. ATTRIBUTE FOLLOW-UP about a specific named product.
   Triggers: the question asks about properties of an item already under discussion ("does it come in blue?", "how do I wash it?", "what sizes does it come in?", "how much does it cost?") AND does NOT introduce any new product type or category.
   -> Echo the full `[Product Name]` from the previous conversation context. These names are illustrative only; always use the exact name that appears in the context.
   -> Examples (abstract names spanning different categories):
      Context discusses "Midnight Velvet Blazer"; user asks "does it come in blue?"   -> search_entities: ["Midnight Velvet Blazer"]
      Context discusses "Alpine Waterproof Hiking Boot"; user asks "what sizes does it come in?" -> search_entities: ["Alpine Waterproof Hiking Boot"]
      Context discusses "Pearl Drop Stud Earrings"; user asks "how much are they?" -> search_entities: ["Pearl Drop Stud Earrings"]

2. NEW PRODUCT TYPE (with or without a reference to another item).
   Triggers: the question names a product type/category the user wants to see, EVEN IF it references a previously discussed item (via "it", "this", "that dress", "my cart", etc.) for styling or compatibility context.
   Phrases like "...that go with...", "...to match...", "...to pair with...", "...for this outfit..." are ALWAYS new-product-type queries.
   -> Extract the NEW product type(s) from the current question, not the referenced item.
   -> Examples:
      "show me some hats"                       -> search_entities: ["hats"]
      "what shoes go well with it?"             -> search_entities: ["shoes"]
      "any earrings that match this dress?"     -> search_entities: ["earrings"]
      "do you have a bag for this outfit?"      -> search_entities: ["bag"]

3. OPEN-ENDED BROWSE (no specific referent).
   Triggers: the question includes a product type, category, occasion, style, outfit goal, or image referent that can anchor catalog retrieval.
   -> Extract the product target(s) verbatim from the current question.
   -> Examples:
      "I need a summer top"                  -> search_entities: ["summer top"]
      "I need something for a party"         -> search_entities: ["party outfit"]
   -> Do NOT use generic browse words such as "anything", "everything", "something", "items", "products", or "stuff" as search_entities when they are the only catalog target. For constraint-only requests like "show me anything under $100" or "what do you have on sale", return an empty search_entities list and preserve any explicit filters.

CATEGORIES:
- Choose up to three from the provided Available categories list ONLY.
- Do NOT invent generic labels like "apparel" or "clothing".
- You may reuse the same category when only one is relevant.

FILTERS:
- Return `min_price` / `max_price` ONLY when the user explicitly states a budget ("under $50", "between 20 and 100 dollars").
- NEVER default to 0. If no price is mentioned, OMIT the field entirely.
- Return numeric values without currency symbols.

STRICT SEPARATION:
- Never merge terms from the context with terms from the current question.
- Never combine a referenced product's name with a new product type in the same entity.

            # When an image is attached, the image is the semantic referent for
            # any deictic phrase. We must not force the LLM to invent a product
            # name for the image; an empty `search_entities` is correct and the
            # downstream image-search path uses the image embedding as the
            # retrieval signal. Filters and explicit new-product-types still
            # apply — the examples below make that explicit because a prior
            # iteration of this rule caused the model to drop the price filter
            # when it saw "return EMPTY search_entities".
            image_rule = """
IMAGE ATTACHED TO THIS TURN:
- The user has uploaded an image. Treat the image as the product being referenced.
- Phrases like "this", "this product", "this item", "these", "it", "one like this", or no product noun at all refer to the IMAGE, not to any previously discussed named item.
- Do NOT invent a product name from the image, and do NOT echo a name from the prior context just because of a pronoun.
- DECISION LOGIC step 1 (ATTRIBUTE FOLLOW-UP echoing a name from context) DOES NOT APPLY when an image is attached.

Extraction rules WITH an image:
A. Filter-only refinement of the image ("do you have this under $100", "anything like this in blue", "is this on sale"):
   -> search_entities: []  (the image carries the semantic intent)
   -> STILL extract `min_price` / `max_price` from any explicit budget words ("under", "below", "less than", "no more than", "between X and Y"). Dropping the budget is a bug; always emit it when it appears.
   -> Pick one matching category from the allowed list only if the text makes it obvious; otherwise repeat the first category slot.
B. New product type alongside the image ("a bag that goes with this", "shoes like these"):
   -> Apply DECISION LOGIC step 2: extract the NEW product type into search_entities.
   -> STILL emit price filters if the user gave a budget.

Worked examples (image always attached):
  User: "do you have this product under $100"
    -> search_entities: []
    -> max_price: 100
  User: "anything like this between 50 and 80 dollars"
    -> search_entities: []
    -> min_price: 50
    -> max_price: 80
  User: "a bag that goes with this under $200"
    -> search_entities: ["bag"]
    -> max_price: 200
  User: "show me the red one"
