# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Catalog Enrichment System

**Version:** 1.4.0
**Last Updated:** 24-Jul-2026  
**Owner:** Open Source Community

## Problem Statement

Product catalogs often contain minimal, low-quality information with basic product images and sparse descriptions. This limits customer engagement, search discoverability, and overall user experience. Manual enrichment of catalog data is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale. Human categorization and tagging of products is particularly susceptible to inconsistencies, subjective interpretations, and classification errors that can negatively impact search functionality and user experience.

Additionally, product catalogs quickly become outdated as market trends, customer preferences, and styling conventions evolve. Catalog managers lack visibility into how customers are actually using products in real-world contexts, what terminology resonates with target audiences, and what trends are emerging on social media platforms. This disconnect between catalog content and market reality leads to missed opportunities for engagement and conversion.

## Solution Overview

A GenAI-powered catalog enrichment system that transforms basic product images into comprehensive, rich catalog entries with enhanced titles, descriptions, categories, tags, variation images (2D/3D), and short video clips. The system leverages social media content analysis to incorporate trending styles, real-world usage patterns, and customer sentiment into product enrichment, ensuring catalog data stays current with market trends.

## Core User Flow

1. **Input**: User submits product image along with existing product JSON data and optional locale specification
2. **Social Media Analysis** (Optional): System retrieves and analyzes social media content for similar products to extract:
   - Trending styles and terminology
   - Real-world usage scenarios and contexts
   - Customer sentiment and common feedback
   - Popular color combinations and styling preferences
   - Complementary products and accessories
3. **Content Augmentation**: System uses Qwen2-VL vision-language model to enhance existing product data by:
   - Enriching product title with more descriptive details (localized to target region)
   - Expanding product description with richer, more verbose content (using regional terminology)
   - Improving and refining attributes (e.g., expanding "Black" to "Matte Black with Silver Hardware")
   - Enhancing categories and subcategories based on visual analysis
   - Generating more comprehensive and accurate tags
   - Validating and correcting product specifications against visual evidence
   - Incorporating trending terminology and insights from social media analysis (when available)
4. **Cultural Prompt Planning**: System uses LLaMA 3.1 LLM to create culturally-aware prompts for image generation based on:
   - Product analysis
   - Target locale/country cultural context
   - Regional aesthetic preferences
   - Social media trend insights (when available)
5. **Localized Image Generation**: System creates variation images using FLUX models with culturally-appropriate backgrounds
6. **Quality Assessment**: System evaluates generated images using VLM-based reflection to verify:
   - Product consistency and fidelity
   - Size and scale proportions
   - Anatomical accuracy (if applicable)
   - Background quality and realism
7. **3D Asset Creation**: System generates 3D product assets using Microsoft's TRELLIS model
8. **Video Generation**: System produces 3-5 second product video clips using open-source models
9. **Output**: Culturally-enriched catalog entry with quality-assessed generated assets optimized for target market, enhanced with social media insights

- Support deduplication of repeated policy uploads by content hash
- Display compliance results in the UI with visual pass/fail indicators

### FR-13: Protocol Schema Export (ACP & UCP)
- Generate ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) and UCP (Unified Commerce Protocol) schema instances from enriched product data
- Use LLM to extract structured attributes (brand, material, age_group, gender, product_details, product_highlights, short_title, google_product_category) from enriched title and description
- Merge LLM-extracted fields with enriched data and deterministic defaults (availability, condition, adult, is_bundle) into full schema templates
- ACP schema covers product, pricing, FAQs, agent actions, fulfillment, campaigns, certifications, energy efficiency, bundling, marketplace, and metadata
- UCP schema follows Google Merchant Center Product Data Specification across all 9 sections (basic product data, price/availability, product category, identifiers, detailed description, shopping campaigns, marketplaces, destinations, shipping/returns)
- UCP uses `structured_title` and `structured_description` with `digital_source_type: "trained_algorithmic_media"` for AI-generated content
- Single `/protocols/generate` endpoint calls LLM once and returns both schemas
- UI displays schemas in a Protocols tab with ACP/UCP sub-tabs, syntax-highlighted JSON, and copy-to-clipboard
- Schema generation fires in the background after FAQ generation completes, ensuring FAQs are included in both schemas
